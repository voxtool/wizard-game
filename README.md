1.Simple browser game

- This game was created as a workshop assignment from SoftUni
- The assets belong to SoftUni

2.Additional improvements added by me outside of the spec include:
 
- implementation of a life system(by default you have 3 lives)
- progressive scaling of the game based on time passed aka Hard Mode(spawn rate, speed and number of enemies increases each X minutes)

3.To play just download/clone and unzip ina a folder then open the .html file

4.You can fine tune the difficulty in the main.js file
